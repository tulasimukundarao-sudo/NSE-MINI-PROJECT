 Project Title

Expense Tracker System


Project Description

The Expense Tracker System is a menu-driven Python console application developed as part of the Python Mini Project assignment.
The main objective of this project is to help users record, view, search, and save daily expense details in a simple and structured way.

This project demonstrates the practical use of basic Python programming concepts such as lists, dictionaries, functions, loops, conditional statements, exception handling, and file handling.



Objectives of the Project

* To design a simple real-life application using Python
* To store expense details efficiently using lists and dictionaries
* To provide a user-friendly menu-based interface
* To save expense records permanently using file handling


 Features

The Expense Tracker System provides the following features:

* Add Expense
  Allows the user to enter expense details such as date, category, and amount.

* View Expenses
  Displays all the expenses stored in the system in a clear and readable format.

* Search Expense by Category
  Enables the user to search and view expenses belonging to a particular category.

* Save & Exit
  Saves all expense records into a text file and exits the program safely.


Concepts Used

This project is developed strictly using the concepts taught in class:

* Lists – To store multiple expense records
* Dictionaries – To store individual expense details
* Functions– To modularize the code and improve readability
* Conditional Statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) – To handle menu choices
* Loops (`while`) – To repeatedly display the menu
* String Methods (`strip()`, `upper()`) – To clean and standardize user input
* Exception Handling (`try` / `except`) – To handle invalid numeric input
* File Handling (`open()` / `with open()`) – To save expense data permanently

Data Storage Design

The project uses a **list of dictionaries** for storing expense data.

* The list stores multiple expense records
* Each dictionary represents one expense record

Example:


{"Date": "20-01-2026", "Category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "Amount": 420}


This structure allows easy addition, searching, and display of expenses.


 File Handling

* Expense records are saved in a file named expenses.txt
* The file is created automatically when the user selects Save & Exit
* Each expense record is written on a new line in the file

This ensures that the data is not lost after the program ends.

 How to Run the Program

Follow the steps below to execute the program:

1. Install Python on your system
2. Save the program file as:

  
   expense_tracker.py
  
3. Open Command Prompt / Terminal
4. Navigate to the folder containing the file
5. Run the program using:

   ```
   python expense_tracker.py
   ```

Menu Options

The program displays the following menu options:

1. Add Expense
2. View Expenses
3. Search Expense by Category
4. Save & Exit

The menu continues to appear until the user chooses the exit option.

 Input Guidelines

* Date should be entered in DD-MM-YYYY format
* Category should be entered as text (e.g., FOOD, TRAVEL, ENTERTAINMENT)
* Amount should be entered as a numeric value

Invalid inputs are handled using exception handling.


 Output

* Expense details are displayed on the console
* Saved expense records can be viewed in the `expenses.txt` file
